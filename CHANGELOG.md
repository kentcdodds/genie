# Latest

# 0.5.0

- Remove all lamps
- Modernize the tooling of the project

# 0.4.0

- Pulling in ux-genie.
- Reorganizing some of the project.
- Creating slots for lamps made to work with other frameworks and libraries.
- Starting tests for ux-genie.
- Bug Fix: Path Contexts would only match the first group in the regex. One character change.

# 0.3.0

- Breaking changes: Changed how wishes are registered. Now you
can only register with objects and arrays of objects. You can't
register by parameters. There were just too many parameters,
and everyone using this was using objects/arrays anyway.
Also changing context a tad internally. Now all context will
be created as an object. Though a string or array can still
be provided, it will be assigned to the `context.any` property.
- Update to the matching algorithm to improve suggestions.
- Genie now adds a `data` property to all wishes with a
`timesMade` object indicating how many times that wish had
been made (how many times the action was called) total as well
as with specific magic words.
- Added getWishesWithContext(context, type, wishContextTypes)
- Added getWishesInContext(context)
- Added getWish(id)
- Added overrideMatchingAlgorithm(function(wishes, magicWord, enteredMagicWords){}).
See README.
- Adding autodocs
- Added restoreMatchingAlgorithm()
- Seriously documented some functions.
- Adding jshint to the build. Some errors corrected.
- Old tests fixed/removed
- Updated README accordingly

# 0.2.5

- Big improvement to context. Added complex context functionality
allowing for more fine control over what wishes are in context and
which are not.

# 0.2.4

- Bug fix: if a wish is deregistered, it is removed from the entered
magic words, but the entry in the entered magic words remained even
if it was empty.

# 0.2.3

- Added the pathContext feature
- Added some internal helpers
- Added this changelog file :)
